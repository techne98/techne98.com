title: "Making my personal website a digital teahouse"

Something about brewing a cup of tea and sitting and drinking it is literally one of my favourite rituals in life.

Same goes for coffee. Smelling ground coffee is one of the amazing small pleasures you can appreciate in life.

I've been thinking about this a lot, and always think about my content as ideally being a place someone can sit down with a cup of tea and stroll around my thoughts - whether it's polished blog posts, or unfinished notes, or random research. 

This aligns closely with what are called [digital gardens](). Instead of a typical chronological blog, posts have tags and linked to each other where appropriate. They don't have to be "blog" posts. This is a bit like Obsidian et al.

This is the vibe I want to achieve with my personal website - so why a **teahouse**? 

What I want to push towards is not only this strolling through the garden and seeing thoughts which may or may not be connected, I want it more to be a place where someone can sit down and flick open a book, or a magazine, or scroll, or whatever.

The difference to me is a teahouse or coffeehouse or cafe, or whatever is also inherently social. 

This is a little bit contradictory for me because I normally sit in a cafe alone (lol), but I want to add some features to my website which makes the experience feel a little more social. 

I'm unsure of what this is going to look like yet. Maybe some indicator of how many people are reading alongside you, or maybe highlighting notes/posts and being able to share your own thoughts. 

In essence I want to add that conversation you get with friends or family and incorporate it into my personal website. 

We'll see how it goes!
