    <p class="text-xl">I am an independent web engineer &amp; technical writer.</p>
    <p>
    For the last few years I've worked with startups as a lead technical writer and developer relations engineer,
    focused on user-facing web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some current areas that interest me include web-focused developer tooling and ergonomics, runtimes, and WebAssembly.
