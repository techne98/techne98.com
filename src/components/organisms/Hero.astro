    I am interested in developer tools, platforms and systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the last 
        few years I've worked with fintech startups as a technical writer and developer relations engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
    This has shifted my focus to understanding computers more deeply in order to build better tools, and 
    create more efficient platforms and infrastructure.

    I am a strong believer that we sometimes learn best from those who are only a few steps ahead of us. You can 
    check out my <a class="text-neutral-50 underline" href="/blog">blog</a> for guides, learnings, and devlogs, or take a look at my projects on

    <p>Enjoy your stay. 🍵</p>
